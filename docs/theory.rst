1. **Characterization of laser beams: theory and application in laser-assisted bonding process**
    
    This tutorial paper offers a pedagogial introduction to the theory and
    application of laser beam analysis through the use of a minimum working
    example. It is ideal for newcomers to the field of laser beam
    characterization.

2. **ISO 136944:2018**
    
    The official ISO document that specifies the test methods and parameters
    for the characterization of laser beam power density distribution. It is
    handy for those already familiar to the field of laser beam characterization.

    :Parameters: total power, clip-level power, maximum power density,
                 clip-level, power density, clip-level average power density,
                 clip-level irradiation area, beam aspect ratio,
                 fractional power, flatness factor, beam uniformity, plateau
                 uniformity, edge steepness.
    

.. _ISO 11145:

3. **ISO 11145:2018**

    The official ISO document that defines basic terms, symbols, and units of
    measurement for the field of laser technology. It is suitable for those
    already familiar to the field of laser beam characterization.

    :Access: https://www.iso.org/standard/72944.html
    :Parameters: beam centroid, beam width.
    

.. _Flat-top:

4. **Flat-top shaped laser beams: reliability of standard parameters**

    This paper proposes a slight modification to the ISO standards in order
    to improve its reliability. It is ideal for those who fully understand the
    ISO standards and regonize its limitation.

.. _Specifying:

5. **Specifying excimer beam uniformity**

    This paper defines the *top-hat factor*, a non-ISO definition that serves a
    a genral indicator of beam quality with a single number. It is relevant for
    those already familiar with the ISO standards and want to explore other
    characterizing parameters commonly used in the industry.
