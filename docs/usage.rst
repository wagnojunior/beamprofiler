Power Density Distribution
--------------------------

To use **BeamProfiler** you must first measure the *power density distribution
(pdd)* of the laser beam you want to analyse, and save it as `.csv`, `.xls`, or
`.xlsx` in a known location. **BeamProfiler** expects the *pdd* to comply with
the standard layout to function properly.



If your *pdd* was measured with the
*PRIMES LaserDiagnosticsSoftware v2.98.81*, then don't worry as it already
complies with the standard layout. If your *pdd* was measured with another
software, the

.. note::

   **BeamProfiler** was designed using the power density distribution generated
   by *PRIMES BeamMonitor BM+ 100*

.. note::

    To use **BeamProfiler** out of the box the file containing the power density
    distribution of the laser beam must follow a specific format.
